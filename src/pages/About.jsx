            Electronic commerce, also known as ecommerce is a type of industry
            where buying and selling of a product is conducted over electronic
            systems such as the internet. The purpose of this application is to
            bring knowledge to students about ecommerce and how an interactive
            ecommerce application can be designed from scratch using client-side
            languages, such as JavaScript and HTML, combined with the
            server-side Java language through Java Server Faces. The server
            side, mostly Java, contains all the implementation related to
            setting up the database, creating session models for joining
            different user-interface (UI) pages, calculating the shipping costs
            and sales tax, etc. It is responsible for taking information from
            the database and making it available to the UI by mapping the
            category or item ID to the respective IDs stored in the database.
            The client side is responsible for showing the entire user
            interface, containing the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
